# **Zeta2D**

2D mechanics physics engine.
The 2D counterpart to the Zeta Physics Engine.  
It is intended to be used by a 2D graphics system for physics.
___

## To Use
* Clone the Zeta2D repository.
* Run the build.bat script contained in the repo.
* Copy the ZETA folder into your include directory.
* Copy libzeta2d.a and zeta2d.dll into their respective spots in your main project.
* `#include <ZETA/physicshandler.h>` in the file you want to use it in.
___

## Documentation
Zeta documentation can be found [here](https://salamence064.github.io/Zeta2D/).
___

## Header Only Version
If you would like to use a header-only version of this library, check out the [Header-Only branch](https://github.com/Salamence064/Zeta2D/tree/Header-Only).
___

## The Original
* The original [Zeta Physics Engine](https://github.com/aggie-coding-club/Zeta-Physics-Engine) is a 3D header-only mechanics physics engine.
* Check it out if you're working on a 3D project.
___

## Planned Additions
* Addition of an examples directory
* Rotational kinematics
* Optimize Physics Handler code (especially code relating to impulse resolution)
